Course Project Repro
=====================

This repro contains required submissions for the course project, which is described in the assignment as:
```
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
```

The files in the repro are:

- README.md - description of this project and the repro
- CodeBook.md - describing variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data
- run_analysis.R - R script that performs the tasks described above in the project description
- tidy_averages.txt - output of R script

See CodeBook.md for addtional information on the data sets, transformations, and the run_analysis.R script.
